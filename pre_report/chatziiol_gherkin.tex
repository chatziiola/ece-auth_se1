And I see my shared Music B
And I see a list of the people follow me
And I see a list list of the people I follow back


Scenario: View another user's profile
Checking out a different user's account should include a follow/unfollow button.

When that account is not my account
Then I see their imported music A
And I see their rated entries
And I see their shared Music B
And I see a list of the people that follow them
And I see a list of the people they follow
And I have the option to with follow/unfollow that user
\end{verbatim}

And I have the option to follow/unfollow

A user should be able to log in to the music streaming service of their choice, should that be supported by our platform.

# Given that service is in the list of supported music streaming services
# And there is no error in the verification process
When I select a music streaming service to log in to
Then I should be refered to that service for external sign in
And that platform, along with my account on it should be added to my profile information


Scenario: Unsuccessful run / Abort


A user unable to log in externally to a music platform should be redirected to the platform selection page.

# Given that service is in the list of supported music streaming services
# And there is an error in the verification process
When I select a music streaming service to log in to
Then I should be alerted of an error in the verification process
And I should be redirected to the prompt to choose a music streaming service to log in
